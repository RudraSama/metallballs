# Metaballs

**Metaballs** are organic-looking blobs used in computer graphics to simulate soft merging shapes (often for fluids or blobby characters). They are defined mathematically as fields that influence the space around them.

We just tried to render metaballs in X11 using xcb API and pixmap. It has weird effect doing merging of two metaballs.

## Refrence
Metaballs are explained in detail [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs).
